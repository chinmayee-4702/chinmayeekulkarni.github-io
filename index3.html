            <div class="container">
            <p>In hopes of helping the underprivileged parts of society, Paakhi- a social initiative founded by MindSpark, conducted a 'Health and Hygiene during Menstruation' awareness campaign in the PMC School, Hadapsar, on 12th March. The school girls were informed about personal hygiene, problems faced due to lack of nutrition during periods and were given sanitary pads to encourage good hygiene practices. MindSpark urges everyone to break the silence, and help build awareness about menstrual health and hygiene.</p>

            <p>If women are expected to do the same work as men, we must teach them the same things. With this purpose in mind and to commemorate Women's day, MS enthusiastically collaborated with Deep Griha Society, an independent charitable organization in teaching women in slum areas the correct usage of mobile phones and technology in today's world . Step by step, MindSpark aims to strengthen the foundation of technical literacy for a better future.</p></div>
